                MAX
            </p>
            <p class="XA">
                A 10yr old boy known as Max, is one of the main campers at Camp Campbell as well as the main protagonist. He has a cynical attitude about the camp that tends to clash wtih David's perky demeanor. Hs's known as the troublemaker and has a goal of wanting to escape the camp as well as wanting to "break David's facade". Max is extremely passimistic and seems to despise a wide variety of things, especially Camp Campbell. Althugh he is only 10, Max definately uses colorful vocabulary that he isn't afraid to use, especially around authority figures and becuase he he is more mature and very smart then the other campers, he shows lack of fear in terrifying solustions.

                NIKKI
            </p>
            <p class="KI">
                Nikki, another one of the main campers, is a highy energetic and is known as the adventurous camper. Because she is so energetic and actually enjoys the action-packed eccentricity, danger of Camp Campbell, she describes herself as "an agent of chaos". She orginally was apart of the Flower Scouts, but was kicked out because she wasn't "flower scout material". One of the main reasons she's at Camp Campbell is becuase it is believed that her mother had lied to her about what camp she was going to.

                NEIL
            </p>
            <p class="IL">
                Like Nikki, Neil was tricked into going to Camp Campbell, thinking that it was science camp. When it comes to the camps science section, Neil tends to get angry because it doesn't fit his epectations. Neil doesn't only have a passion for science, but actually seems to have a talent for the many things the Flower Scouts do, such as drawing and coloring, sewing, embroidery, and minding manners at the table. He also seems to dislike nature immensely and has serious stage fright.

                DAVID
            </p>
            <p class="ID">
                David is one of the camp's counselors, as well as the deuteragonist of Camp Camp. He is an upbeat, enthusiastic, happy-go-lucky guy that would do anything to show the brightside of camping, which causes a clash with Max, who despises everything about camping. He has claimed that he lies in bed awake in eager anticipation for the next day rather then actually sleeping and he is the type to not swear, except on ocassion in an episode. 
            <p class="GW">
                GWEN
            </p>
            <p class="EN">
                Like David, Gwen is another one of the camp's counselors. She is known as being cynical and seems to always somewhat be in a bad mood and because she's been rejected by many other jobs, it adds to her mood. She tends to frequently be on the verge of a nervous breakdown because of her career choices. To EVEN MORE add on to her mood, the antics of the campers also irritates her. Aside from being in a mood most of the time, Gwen is actually quite the fangirl as she obssess over 'Doctor who' and other series. She also has a weakness for trashy reality TV as well as likes fanfiction. Unlike David, she swears.
